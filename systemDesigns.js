// this project might change and evolve a lot, so should focus on modularity
//  ability to switch out parts

// work incrementally - while considering big picture is important, not all pieces have to be in place at the start

// little bit of functionality, little bit of cleanup. repeat

// should not aim to make it perfect:
// will need to test a lot of different configurations anyway.
// even if one model fails, it might still provide interesting data.

// add pause, speedup, slowdown, (reverse)
